= Traffic Controller

A simple demo to show how to simulate a Traffic signal using [Quarkus] [https://quarkus.io] and [Apache Kafka] (https://kafka.apache.org)

== Steps run the demo

video::385671631[viemo]

From your project directory, where you have cloned this project run:

Start Kafka, from a terminal window 

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
---
$ *docker-compose up*
----

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
---
$ *./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev*
----

Once both the applications Kafka and Quarkus are running open the URL http://localhost:8080  to the directional traffic dot. Please do keep the window size small to see all the directions.

On the Quarkus logs you should see the some random traffic info being sent by the backend (Kafka)
and the Traffic signal will change as per the weight of the traffic in each direction. The random traffic signal is generated every 30 seconds.
